      <strong>Data</strong><br/>
      Basic non-identifiable information about your user on the website is collected; the majority of which is provided during first-time login, such as email addresses and usernames.<br />
      In addition to this, IP addresses for registered users are stored within the system to aid with moderation duties. This includes spam prevention, and detecting alternative accounts.<br /><br />
      <em style="color: #444444 !important;">Account data can be deleted by a site administrator upon request, which will remove all data relating to your user from our system.</em><br /><br />
      <strong>Cookies</strong><br />

      <strong>Arc</strong><br />
      <em style="color: #444444 !important;">VoidList.xyz is faster with Arc.</em> Arc loads content from people's devices near you instead of from slower servers. In return, it helps your device provide content to others.<br />
      <em style="color: #444444 !important;">Arc lets VoidList.xyz earn money with less ads.</em> Just by being here, you share a little bandwidth for VoidList.xyz and help create a faster Internet with fewer ads.<br />
      <em style="color: #444444 !important;">You're safe and in control.</em> Arc doesn't impact your data or performance, and you can opt out any time.<br />
